  {
    question: "What do I need to set up IPTV?",
    answer:
      "To set up IPTV, you need three elements: a reliable high-speed internet connection (recommended 25+ Mbps for HD and 50+ Mbps for 4K), a compatible streaming device or Smart TV, and a third-party IPTV player application. Once you have these, you simply enter the subscription credentials (Xtream Codes API details or M3U playlist link) provided with your TryIPTV account.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I set up using Xtream Codes API or M3U playlist?",
    answer:
      "We recommend using Xtream Codes API whenever your player application supports it. Xtream Codes separates your login into Server URL, Username, and Password, which loads channels faster, automatically organizes Live TV, Movies, and Series into clean categories, and syncs the EPG guide automatically. M3U playlist URLs are an excellent universal alternative for software like VLC or older media players that lack API support.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I set up IPTV directly on a Smart TV without an external stick?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Most modern Smart TVs support IPTV directly. Samsung Smart TVs running Tizen OS and LG Smart TVs running webOS have compatible applications like IPTV Smarters Pro available in their official application stores. If you have an Android TV or Google TV (such as Sony, TCL, or Hisense), you can install players directly from Google Play. However, for the fastest navigation and broadest codec support, a dedicated 4K streaming stick (such as a Fire TV Stick 4K or Apple TV) remains an outstanding option.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I use my IPTV subscription on multiple devices?",
    answer:
      "Yes. You can install your subscription credentials on as many devices as you like (such as your living room TV, bedroom TV, computer, and mobile phone). Every TryIPTV subscription includes 2 simultaneous connections, allowing two devices to stream concurrently at the exact same time.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does my player show an 'Authorization Failed' or 'Invalid Details' error?",
    answer:
      "Authentication errors are almost always caused by a minor typographical mistake in the Server URL, Username, or Password. Double-check for accidental trailing spaces, verify uppercase vs. lowercase characters, and ensure your device has an active internet connection. If the issue continues, consult our login troubleshooting guide.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long does it take to activate and configure my subscription?",
    answer:
      "Credentials are automatically prepared and typically delivered within 5–15 minutes following order or trial confirmation. Once you receive your credentials, entering your Server URL, Username, and Password into your player completes the initial connection.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does TryIPTV lock me into a recurring contract?",
    answer:
      "No. All TryIPTV plans are 100% prepaid with flat, one-time pricing for 1, 3, 6, or 12 months. There is no automatic renewal, recurring billing, or hidden charges. When your period ends, you decide whether to extend your service.",
