  {
    question: "What does EPG stand for?",
    answer:
      "EPG stands for Electronic Programme Guide. It is the digital schedule system used by television receivers, set-top boxes, and IPTV media player applications to display broadcast timetables, program titles, synopses, and upcoming schedules in a navigable on-screen grid.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is EPG data part of the video stream itself?",
    answer:
      "No. In IPTV architecture, EPG data is transmitted as separate structured text metadata (commonly formatted as XML or JSON) rather than being embedded inside the video stream's audio and video packets. Because they travel over separate network requests, a video channel can stream smoothly even when its schedule data is missing or out of sync.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why does a channel work while the guide says 'No Information'?",
    answer:
      "If a channel plays video but the guide displays 'No Information' or a blank bar, the media player successfully downloaded and decoded the video stream URL, but it could not find matching schedule records. This typically occurs when the EPG source lacks data for that specific channel, the channel's identifier does not match the guide database, or the guide data has not yet refreshed.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is XMLTV the same thing as an EPG?",
    answer:
      "Not exactly. EPG is the broad concept of an interactive television program guide. XMLTV is a specific, widely adopted XML-based file format used to structure and distribute that schedule data between servers and media players.",
  },
  {
    question: "What is tvg-id used for in IPTV playlists?",
    answer:
      "The tvg-id attribute is a common community convention used in Extended M3U playlists to link a streaming channel to its corresponding schedule entry in an XMLTV guide. It provides a unique identifier string that media players match against the channel IDs defined in the EPG file.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does every IPTV player app support an EPG?",
    answer:
      "Most dedicated IPTV players—such as TiviMate, IPTV Smarters Pro, Televizo, and OTT Navigator—support EPG integration via XMLTV URLs or provider APIs. However, general-purpose media players (such as basic VLC setups or standard web players) often focus purely on stream playback and may require manual configuration or lack a schedule grid altogether.",
  },
  {
    question: "Why can EPG schedule times be offset by several hours?",
    answer:
      "Schedule times can appear several hours ahead or behind if there is a mismatch between the broadcast timezone recorded in the EPG file and the system clock or timezone configured on your streaming device. In some cases, daylight saving adjustments or player-specific manual offset settings can also cause timing shifts.",

                An <strong className="text-foreground font-semibold">EPG (Electronic Programme Guide)</strong> is
                structured schedule metadata used by media players and television software to display what is

              </p>
              <p className="mt-3 text-base leading-7 text-muted-foreground">
                In modern IPTV systems, <strong className="text-foreground font-semibold">EPG data is completely separate from the video stream itself</strong>.
                A video channel can stream video and audio flawlessly even when its EPG data is missing,

              <h2>Core Concepts: What Information Does an EPG Contain?</h2>
              <p>
                In traditional cable and satellite broadcasting, schedule data is transmitted alongside video
                frequencies via dedicated broadcast metadata tables. In internet-delivered television,
                EPG data is distributed as structured text files—most commonly using XML or JSON—that
                your player application downloads, parses, and arranges into an on-screen grid.
              </p>
              <p>
                A comprehensive EPG entry typically contains several key data elements, depending on the
                source and depth of the listing:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>Channel Identity:</strong> Identifies the network or station, including the channel
                  name, unique identifier code, and optional network icon or logo URL.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Programme Title:</strong> The official name of the movie, sporting event, news
                  broadcast, or episodic television show.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Start and End Timestamps:</strong> Exact scheduled broadcast times, typically recorded
                  with timezone or UTC offset indicators to establish the precise broadcast window.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Programme Synopsis and Description:</strong> Narrative summary of the episode or
                  broadcast, often supplemented by content ratings, genre tags, and original air dates.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Episodic Metadata:</strong> When provided by the upstream feed, listings may include
                  season numbers, episode numbers, director credits, and cast listings.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Schedule Grid Coordinates:</strong> Coordinates that allow the player application to
                  position programmes along a visual timeline, showing past, current, and upcoming broadcasts.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                <em>Note:</em> Not every EPG source supplies all of these metadata attributes. Some lightweight
                or community feeds provide only basic titles and broadcast times, while full commercial feeds
                include rich synopses and high-resolution poster artwork.
              </p>

              <h2>How IPTV Players Receive EPG Data</h2>
              <p>
                Unlike traditional digital television receivers that pull guide tables from an over-the-air
                multiplex, IPTV applications obtain schedule data through the internet. Depending on your
                player application and service configuration, EPG data is usually delivered through one of
                three ingestion mechanisms:

                The completeness of the guide depends on the player and service implementation. Even when a
                service supports Xtream-compatible APIs, the provider must actively curate and maintain
                upstream guide schedules for each channel in their catalog. If the provider does not supply
                data for a particular stream, the player will simply display an empty time block.

              <h2>XMLTV at a Glance: The Common Language of TV Guides</h2>
              <p>
                The most widely supported open standard for distributing television listings across the
                internet is <strong className="text-foreground font-semibold">XMLTV</strong>. Originally developed
                as an open-source project to gather TV listings, XMLTV defines an XML document structure
                containing two primary elements:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <code>&lt;channel&gt;</code> blocks: Define individual stations, their unique ID codes, display
                  names, and channel logos.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <code>&lt;programme&gt;</code> blocks: Define individual scheduled broadcasts, referenced by the
                  channel ID, with start/stop timestamps, title, description, and category.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A simplified conceptual snippet of XMLTV data looks like this:

              <p>
                Because complete television listings for hundreds of channels can span tens of megabytes of raw
                text, XMLTV files are frequently compressed using gzip into <code>.xml.gz</code> files to reduce
                server bandwidth and download times.
              </p>

              <h2>Channel Matching: Connecting Streams to Schedule Data</h2>
              <p>
                An IPTV playlist file (such as an M3U file) is essentially a list of video addresses, while an
                EPG file is a list of broadcast schedules. How does a media player know which schedule belongs
                to which video stream?
              </p>
              <p>
                To connect them, the player relies on channel matching rules:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <strong>The <code>tvg-id</code> Attribute:</strong> In Extended M3U playlists, the{" "}
                  <code>tvg-id</code> tag is a community-standard metadata attribute that specifies the exact ID
                  of the matching channel in the EPG file. For example, if a channel line contains{" "}
                  <code>tvg-id=&quot;espn.us&quot;</code>, the player searches the EPG file for the{" "}
                  <code>&lt;channel id=&quot;espn.us&quot;&gt;</code> definition. Note that <code>tvg-id</code> is
                  a de facto community convention popularized by open-source players (like Kodi and VLC), not an
                  official IETF standard.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Channel Name Matching:</strong> If <code>tvg-id</code> is missing or blank, many modern
                  players attempt a fuzzy match using the channel&apos;s visible display name against the{" "}
                  <code>&lt;display-name&gt;</code> tags in the guide file.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Provider-Assigned Stream IDs:</strong> When connecting via Xtream-compatible APIs, the
                  server handles the association internally by linking each numerical stream ID directly to its
                  associated schedule database entry.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Not all player applications handle channel mapping identically. While some players match strictly
                on exact ID strings, advanced players (such as TiviMate and Televizo) allow users to manually
                reassign a channel to any guide entry directly from the on-screen menu if automatic matching
                fails.
              </p>

              <h2>Timezones and Timestamps: Why Guide Times Disagree</h2>
              <p>
                Every programme entry in an EPG contains start and end timestamps. In standard XMLTV files, these
                timestamps include an explicit timezone or UTC offset (such as <code>+0000</code> for UTC or{" "}
                <code>-0500</code> for Eastern Standard Time).
              </p>
              <p>
                When your player loads this data, it converts the UTC timestamp into your local time based on your
                device&apos;s system clock. A misalignment can occur if:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>The device running the player has an incorrect system clock or manual timezone setting.</li>
                <li>The upstream provider published timestamps without UTC offset notation, causing the player to assume local time.</li>
                <li>Daylight saving time transitions altered the local clock offset without an update to the source listings.</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                If your guide shows the correct show titles but places them one or two hours in the future or
                past, the problem is almost always a timezone conversion discrepancy. For step-by-step
                instructions on correcting time mismatches, see our dedicated guide on{" "}

              <h2>EPG Caching and Refresh Cycles</h2>
              <p>
                Television listings for large channel packages can contain tens of thousands of individual
                programs. Downloading and parsing this volume of data on every channel change would cause severe
                interface lag and consume unnecessary bandwidth.
              </p>
              <p>
                To deliver instantaneous navigation, IPTV players store parsed guide data in a local cache (such
                as an internal SQLite database on your streaming device). The player displays schedule
                information directly from local memory and schedules periodic background updates to retrieve
                new listings.
              </p>
              <p>
                Cache refresh intervals vary significantly across applications:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Some players refresh guide data automatically upon application startup.</li>
                <li>Others schedule automated background downloads at fixed intervals (such as every 12 or 24 hours).</li>
                <li>Most modern players allow users to trigger a manual EPG update on demand from the settings menu.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-sm text-muted-foreground">
                <em>Note:</em> There is no universal standard for cache retention across players. Exact retention
                windows and refresh behaviors are determined by each application&apos;s design and available
                device storage.

              <h2>EPG vs. Video Stream: Separating Metadata from Playback</h2>
              <p>
                A fundamental concept in IPTV architecture is the complete operational independence of stream
                playback and guide metadata:

                Recognizing this separation prevents misplaced troubleshooting. If a channel plays smoothly but
                its guide line is empty, restarting your Wi-Fi router or tweaking stream buffer settings will
                have zero effect. The solution lies entirely within EPG source configuration and channel
                mapping.
