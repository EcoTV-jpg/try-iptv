              <p className={textClass}>
                TiviMate is a TV-focused IPTV player by Armobsoft FZE. It organizes playlists you supply; it does not provide streams or endorse a provider. Before setup, get a direct M3U URL, Xtream Codes server URL and account details, or a Stalker Portal address if your provider supports that method. These are separate from any TiviMate Premium account.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                The official app listing confirms support for M3U, Xtream Codes, and Stalker Portal. If you only have a provider website login, ask the provider which playlist method to use. <Link href="/guides/what-are-xtream-codes" className={linkClass}>Xtream Codes credentials</Link> are one common option.

                TiviMate is designed for Android TV and remote control navigation. On an Android TV or Google TV device with Google Play, install “TiviMate IPTV Player” from the listing by Armobsoft FZE. Launch it with your TV remote and have your provider&apos;s playlist details ready. The app is not optimized for touch-only phones or tablets.
              </p>
              <ol className={listClass}>
                <li>Open Google Play on the TV and search for TiviMate IPTV Player.</li>
                <li>Check that Armobsoft FZE is the developer, then install and open the app.</li>

                For a compatible Android-based Fire TV device, TiviMate provides an official APK at <a href="https://tivimate.com/apk" className={linkClass} target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tivimate.com/apk</a>. Use the Downloader app to open that address, then install the APK. Fire TV menus vary by model and Fire OS version; use the device&apos;s current app-installation permission flow rather than an unofficial APK or a copied short code.
              </p>
              <ol className={listClass}>
                <li>Install Downloader from the Amazon Appstore if it is available on your device.</li>
                <li>Where your Fire TV offers it, open Settings → My Fire TV (or Device &amp; Software) → Developer Options → Install Unknown Apps and allow Downloader. If Developer Options is hidden, check the device&apos;s About screen and current Amazon instructions for your model.</li>
                <li>In Downloader, enter <code className="break-all text-foreground">https://tivimate.com/apk</code>, follow the official download, and approve installation.</li>

              <h2 className={headingClass}>How to Set Up TiviMate with Xtream Codes</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                To connect TiviMate with Xtream Codes, select Add Playlist and choose Xtream Codes. Enter the server URL, username, and password supplied by your IPTV provider, then save the playlist and wait for channels to load. The server URL identifies the service endpoint; the username and password identify your IPTV account. TiviMate does not issue those credentials.
              </p>
              <ol className={listClass}>
                <li>From the first-run screen, select Add Playlist. For an existing setup, open Settings → Playlists → Add playlist.</li>
                <li>Choose Xtream Codes and enter the complete server URL, including the protocol and port if supplied.</li>
                <li>Enter the provider-issued username and password exactly, checking for spaces and mistyped characters.</li>
                <li>Continue, name the playlist, save it, and allow the channel list to load.</li>
              </ol>
              <p className={textClass}>A provider website password may differ from the IPTV password. If the details work in one player but fail here, compare the exact server address and port used in both apps.</p>

              <h2 className={headingClass}>How to Add an M3U Playlist to TiviMate</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                M3U setup uses one direct playlist URL instead of separate Xtream Codes fields. Choose an M3U playlist in TiviMate, paste the full URL provided by your IPTV provider, and save it. Do not paste a provider homepage or shorten the address. Because an M3U URL may contain account information, keep it private.
              </p>
              <ol className={listClass}>
                <li>Select Add Playlist, then choose M3U playlist.</li>

              <p className={textClass}>
                TiviMate&apos;s official Google Play listing includes Stalker Portal among its supported playlist formats. Choose this method only when your provider specifically gives you a Stalker Portal address and any required device or MAC-related details. A regular Xtream Codes server address is not interchangeable with a Stalker Portal URL.
              </p>
              <ol className={listClass}>
                <li>Select Add Playlist, then Stalker Portal.</li>

              <h2 className={headingClass}>How to Configure EPG in TiviMate</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                EPG is the electronic program guide that displays schedules beside channels. TiviMate supports an EPG grid, but guide entries depend on the provider&apos;s data and channel mapping. A playlist may already carry an associated guide source. If schedules stay blank and your provider supplied a separate EPG or XMLTV URL, add it in TiviMate&apos;s EPG source settings and update the guide.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                Check the URL, source assignment, update status, and channel IDs before changing playback settings. Channels can work while EPG data fails independently. See the <Link href="/help/epg-not-working" className={linkClass}>EPG troubleshooting guide</Link> for missing or stale schedules.

              <h2 className={headingClass}>TiviMate Free vs Premium</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                TiviMate can be installed and used as a player without buying a channel subscription from its developer. Premium is an upgrade for app features; it does not include IPTV content. TiviMate officially lists multiple playlists, favorites, catch-up, recording, search, parental controls, personalization, and multiview as app capabilities, but access to individual features may depend on the current app version and entitlement.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                To activate Premium, use TiviMate&apos;s own purchase or sign-in flow and follow its on-screen instructions. Check the current feature list, device terms, and price in that official flow before purchasing; published prices and entitlements can change. Your IPTV provider login remains separate from the TiviMate account.

              <h2 className={headingClass}>Useful TiviMate Settings</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                There is no single best TiviMate setting for every stream. Start with default playback settings, then change one control at a time for a specific problem. Use playlist and EPG update controls when channels or guide data are stale; use favorites and group organization to make navigation easier. TiviMate also lists personalization and parental controls among its app features.
              </p>
              <p className={textClass}>
                If only one channel fails, test another channel before altering playback. If every stream buffers, check the network and provider status first. A player setting cannot restore a provider outage or an expired account. The <Link href="/help/iptv-buffering" className={linkClass}>IPTV buffering guide</Link> helps separate network and source problems.

              <h2 className={headingClass}>How to Add or Organize Channels in TiviMate</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                You normally do not install channels individually in TiviMate. Channels arrive through the M3U, Xtream Codes, or Stalker Portal playlist supplied by your IPTV provider. Refresh the playlist when the provider changes its lineup; if a channel is still absent, ask the provider whether it belongs to your account. TiviMate can help you navigate the channels it receives with favorites and playlist organization.

              <h2 className={headingClass}>TiviMate Troubleshooting</h2>
              <p className={textClass}>
                First identify whether TiviMate cannot load the playlist, can load it but cannot authenticate or play streams, or can play streams without guide data. Record the error text, playlist type, device model, and a few affected channel names before contacting support. If the same playlist fails in another compatible player, the provider or connection is a stronger suspect than TiviMate.
